Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Job Title Distribution

The distribution of the top 20 job titles was visualized using a count plot. This provided a clear picture of the most common roles within the dataset.
Salary Distribution

A histogram was generated to visualize the distribution of salaries. This helped in understanding the range and commonality of different salary brackets.
In-depth Analysis
Average Salary by Job Title

The average salaries for the top 20 job titles were calculated and visualized using a bar plot. This offered insights into which job titles tend to have higher salaries and how they compare with each other.
